# Late Submission Policy

Assignments submitted up to 48 hours after the deadline incur a 10% deduction on the earned score. Work received beyond the 48-hour grace window is recorded as zero unless a documented accommodation is approved in advance by the instructor.

Requests for extensions must be submitted at least 24 hours before the deadline with supporting documentation. Approved extensions will include a revised due date communicated via email.
