_Pilot Mode — No login. Sample data only._

**Note:** This public repository is a cleaned and adapted version of the original *LENA* project, initially developed and hosted on my institution’s internal GitLab instance as part of an AI-enabled learner support pilot.  
This GitHub version is shared for demonstration and discussion purposes in the context of professional applications related to AI-driven education, learner support, and responsible innovation.

LENA (Learning Engagement and Navigation Assistant) is a retrieval-augmented chatbot that helps learners and academic staff navigate course policies, schedules, and support resources with grounded citations, feedback workflows, and lightweight insights suitable for pilot deployments.
